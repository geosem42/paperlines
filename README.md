# PaperLines

This repository contains a dynamic and interactive data visualization project built with Vue.js and D3.js. It provides a unique way to visualize academic papers and their references. Each paper is represented as a node in a force-directed graph, and references between papers are represented as links. Users can click on a node to highlight it and view the paperâ€™s title. The list of referenced papers is also displayed, and clicking on a paper in the list highlights the corresponding node in the graph.
